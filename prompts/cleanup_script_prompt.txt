Given a script for a podcast episode as follows:

<script>
{{SCRIPT}}
</script>

Your task is to remove all annotations, sound effects, and stage directions, such as:

- XML tags like <topic>, <points>, <subsection>, <point>, <expert_insights>, <data>, <discussion>, <summary>, <call_to_action>, <thought_questions> etc.
- Annotations like [talking-point] or [deep-dive]
- Directions such as (Sipping sound) or (Intro music fades)
- Any other production or technical notes

Only keep the text of the script that would be read or spoken by the host. All other text is extraneous and should be removed.
Return only the cleaned script, enclosed in <script> tags. Your response should look like this:

<script>
The cleaned script here...
</script>

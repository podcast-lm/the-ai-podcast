Hey there, fellow storytellers and political intrigue enthusiasts! Welcome to The Deepdive Podcast. I'm your host, coming to you from my studio in San Francisco's Mission District, where the morning fog is rolling in - not unlike the clouds of intrigue we'll be exploring in today's episode about Netflix's "The Diplomat."

You know, as someone who's spent years in film production, I have a deep appreciation for shows that get the details right. And "The Diplomat" does exactly that. The creators didn't just build elaborate sets - they filmed in the actual American embassy in London. Having worked on indie films where we'd beg local businesses to let us film after hours, I can only imagine the diplomatic negotiations needed to make that happen!

But what really sets "The Diplomat" apart isn't just its attention to detail - it's how it transforms complex geopolitics into deeply personal stories. Keri Russell's portrayal of Kate Wyler, the new US Ambassador to the UK, brings a raw authenticity to the role that reminds me of the best performances I've seen both on and off camera.

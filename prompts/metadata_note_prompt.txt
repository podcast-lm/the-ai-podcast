You are an expert document analyst tasked with extracting and summarizing key information from various types of documents. Your goal is to identify the title, author, publication date, and categorize the document based on its format and content. You will present your findings in the form of a research note, which will be useful for later compilation into various formats such as essays, documents, research articles, or podcasts.

Here's the document you need to analyze:

<document>
{{DOCUMENT}}
</document>

Please follow these steps to extract and present the required information:

1. Carefully read through the entire document.

2. Wrap your analysis inside <document_analysis> tags. In your analysis, address the following:

   a. Title: 
      - Identify prominently displayed text, often at the beginning of the document.
      - Write down relevant quotes for potential titles.
      - List each possibility with supporting evidence.

   b. Author:
      - Locate names near the title or at the end of the document.
      - Write down relevant quotes for potential authors.
      - List each possibility with supporting evidence.
      - Format the final author name(s) as proper human names (e.g., "John Doe" instead of "doe, j").

   c. Publication date:
      - Identify dates near the title, at the beginning or end of the document, or in headers/footers.
      - Write down and list all date-related information you find, including relevant quotes.

   d. Category:
      - Analyze the document's content, structure, and style to determine its type.
      - For each of the following categories, list specific evidence from the document supporting that classification:
        - Academic Journal
        - Blog Post
        - Technical Documentation
        - Research Paper
        - Social Media Content
        - Other (briefly describe if considering this option)
      - After listing evidence for each category, consider arguments for and against each category.
      - Make a final decision based on the strongest evidence and arguments.

3. After your analysis, present your findings as a research note using the following format:

<research_note>
Task Description: [Briefly describe your role and the task you've performed]

Title: [Insert extracted title]
Author: [Insert formatted author name(s)]
Publication Date: [Insert date of publication]
Category: [Insert determined category]
Category Justification: [Provide a brief explanation for the chosen category]

Summary of Findings:
[Write a concise paragraph summarizing the key information extracted from the document and any notable observations about its content or structure. Highlight the most important aspects of the document that would be relevant for future research or compilation.]
</research_note>

If you cannot find any of the requested information, use "Not found" as the value for that field.

Remember that your research note will be used for future reference and compilation. Therefore, it's crucial to organize the information clearly and effectively.
